First responsive website about cat's races using BEM css

This my first made responsive website. During creating this site I was learing about BEM CSS and practising my beginner skills about responsiveness.
It doesn't look really good, but that wasn't my main goal. The goal was to learn how to use BEM css and make it responsive. It took me about 1-3hours of just coding. I spent another 2-3hours to read about responsiveness and BEM css to make it right, as It's ready to upload it on a hosting.
